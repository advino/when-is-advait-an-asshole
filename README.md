# when-is-advait-an-asshole

An addition to the Browsing Browser Extension Suite. A key logger that performs sentiment analysis on everything the user types. Everything a user texts is then broadcast to a website along with the sentiment ranking in the form of "is and asshole or is not an asshole."

The purpose of the project is to examine how ML algorithms can add false authority on the nature of all my textual interactions on the web. In an era where internet artifacts are a common form of leverage, it is also a chance to build out a archive of posts each evaluated by a supposedly "objective" entity.
